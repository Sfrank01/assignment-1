			Specifications
			
				Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Fourth Edition)
				The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a subset of SGML that is completely described in this document. Its goal is to enable generic SGML to be served, received, and processed on the Web in the way that is now possible with HTML. XML has been designed for ease of implementation and for interoperability with both SGML and HTML.
			
			
				XSL Transformations (XSLT) Version 2.0
				This specification defines the syntax and semantics of XSLT 2.0, a language for transforming XML documents into other XML documents. XSLT 2.0 is a revised version of the XSLT 1.0 Recommendation [XSLT 1.0] published on 16 November 1999. XSLT 2.0 is designed to be used in conjunction with XPath 2.0, which is defined in [XPath 2.0]. XSLT shares the same data model as XPath 2.0, which is defined in [Data Model], and it uses the library of functions and operators defined in [Functions and Operators]. XSLT 2.0 also includes optional facilities to serialize the results of a transformation, by means of an interface to the serialization component described in [XSLT and XQuery Serialization].
			
			
				XML Path Language (XPath) 2.0
				XPath 2.0 is an expression language that allows the processing of values conforming to the data model defined in [XQuery/XPath Data Model (XDM)]. The data model provides a tree representation of XML documents as well as atomic values such as integers, strings, and booleans, and sequences that may contain both references to nodes in an XML document and atomic values. The result of an XPath expression may be a selection of nodes from the input documents, or an atomic value, or more generally, any sequence allowed by the data model. The name of the language derives from its most distinctive feature, the path expression, which provides a means of hierarchic addressing of the nodes in an XML tree. XPath 2.0 is a superset of [XPath 1.0], with the added capability to support a richer set of data types, and to take advantage of the type information that becomes available when documents are validated using XML Schema. A backwards compatibility mode is provided to ensure that nearly all XPath 1.0 expressions continue to deliver the same result with XPath 2.0.
			
			
				XSL Transformations (XSLT) Version 1.0
				This specification defines the syntax and semantics of XSLT, which is a language for transforming XML documents into other XML documents. XSLT is designed for use as part of XSL, which is a stylesheet language for XML. In addition to XSLT, XSL includes an XML vocabulary for specifying formatting. XSL specifies the styling of an XML document by using XSLT to describe how the document is transformed into another XML document that uses the formatting vocabulary. XSLT is also designed to be used independently of XSL. However, XSLT is not intended as a completely general-purpose XML transformation language. Rather it is designed primarily for the kinds of transformations that are needed when XSLT is used as part of XSL.
			
			
				XML Path Language (XPath) Version 1.0
				XPath is a language for addressing parts of an XML document, designed to be used by both XSLT and XPointer.
